# chalice_example
This example demonstrate invoking AWS lambda deployed by [chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalic) from another lambda.

The main reason of this demo is to show the error related to the issue [1033](https://github.com/aws/chalice/issues/1033)

This repo contains the code needed to install and deploy the lambda using Chalice but you will still need to setup aws credential locally to run the lambda "cha-invoke"
